# Computer Vision Practice

## Overview
This project is the output of a graduate-level course on computer vision and machine learning.
The aim being to take image input data and process it into instructions for a "Pi Car" (a RaspberryPi powered automous vehicle).

## Dependencies (Version Used)
    -numpy (1.11.1) 
    -pandas (0.23.4) 
    -tensorflow-gpu (1.1.0) --non gpu tensorflow should still work fine 
    -tflearn (0.3.2)

## Running Instructions:
    -Training a network: modify any relevant input in the main function of control.py
        -Optional: change directory to image data in train.py
    -Running Trained Network: run net_tester.py (give path to network and path to image file)
